This is a collection of dotfiles for my personal use.
It is managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). [This is a simple guide](https://dr563105.github.io/blog/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/) on how to get started using Stow.

To be able to apply the config files you need to install Gnu Stow: `brew install stow`

Currently this repo contains config files that expects the following to be installed:

- [devenv and nix](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/)
- [Warp](https://warp.dev/): `brew install --cask warp`
- [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
- [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/): `brew install --cask karabiner-elements` Which has keybindings using:
  - [Raycast](https://raycast.com/): `brew install --cask raycast`
  - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/): `brew install --cask rectangle`
  - [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/)
